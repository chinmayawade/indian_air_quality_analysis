# Hourly Indian Air Quality Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques.

Hourly Indian Air Quality Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning, Deep Learning Techniques can help provide accurate and timely information to the public and government agencies about air quality in India. This can aid in making informed decisions related to health, transportation, and urban planning.

To build such a system, we can use machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze air quality data from various sources, including government air quality monitoring stations, satellite imagery, and weather data. The following steps can be taken to develop a system for hourly Indian air quality analysis and prediction:

**Data Collection:** Collect air quality data from multiple sources and build a comprehensive dataset. This data should include information such as pollutant levels, meteorological data, and location information.

**Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess the data to clean and transform it into a usable format. This may involve removing missing data, handling outliers, and normalizing the data.

**Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful features from the data to train machine learning and deep learning models. This can involve analyzing temporal and spatial patterns in the data.

**Model Training:** Train machine learning and deep learning models on the preprocessed data to predict air quality levels. Popular machine learning models for this task include random forests, decision trees, and gradient boosting. Popular deep learning models include convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN).

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the models on the test data. This can be done using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Model Deployment:** Once a suitable model is identified, it can be deployed to make hourly predictions of air quality levels. The model can be integrated into a web application or mobile app to provide users with real-time information on air quality levels in their location.

Overall, an hourly Indian air quality analysis and prediction system using machine learning and deep learning techniques can provide accurate and timely information to the public and government agencies. This can help in taking informed decisions related to health, transportation, and urban planning.
